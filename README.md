# WPF-Wifi-Password-Finder
WPF is a Wi-Fi password finder that works by telling you the password to previously connected Wi-Fi networks.
To use it simply run the .bat file.
To find the wifi password, type out one of the wifi names. IT IS CASE SENSITIVE.
NOTE: THIS ONLY WORKS FOR WIFI's THAT YOU PREVIOUSLY CONNECTED TO.
good for if your parents won't tell you the wifi password
